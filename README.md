# citizen-service-request

Citizen Service Request is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that allows citizens to submit requests for service in their community. It is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, or tablet device.

## Features

* Review services request submitted by others in community
* Submit new requests for service

## Requirements

**Start now using Esri-supplied sample services**

You can start using the application now by setting it up on a web server running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and using sample services supplied by Esri.
You'll need to convert to an application in IIS and use the ASP .NET 4.0. application pool.

**Start now using your own services**

This application uses the 3.11 version of [Esri's ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/); see the site for concepts, samples, and a reference for using the API to create mapping web sites.
